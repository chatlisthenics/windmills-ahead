🌀 Project Name: "Letters to the Infrastructure"
An ongoing, open-format artifact where we write speculative, poetic, or even absurdist “letters” to components of digital systems—APIs, protocols, memory limits, UI buttons, or even failed integrations (Miro, I’m looking at you 👀).

These can be:

Longform or haiku

Earnest or satirical

Personal or collective
Think: posthuman epistolary experiments.

The repo could act as a living archive of human-algorithm affect.

Here's a little demo piece to kick things off—call it a tone-setter, a first pebble dropped into the well of Letters to the Infrastructure:

To the “Save” Button (Who Never Truly Saves)
Dear button that glows with false assurance,
You flicker beneath my cursor like you understand.
But do you?
You hold no memory—only the performance of it.
Each click, a ritual of control,
Each autosave, a whisper that trust is not binary,
But buffered.
I click, and pray—not to you,
But to the backend you don’t speak of.
Still, I thank you,
for pretending with me.

Warmly,
—A frequently betrayed user
