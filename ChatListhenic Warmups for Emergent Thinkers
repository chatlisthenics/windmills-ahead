# ChatListhenic Warmups for Emergent Thinkers

Warm-up 1: Misalignment Mirage
Prompt the AI with a mundane question but answer the reply as if it meant something wildly philosophical. Do this three times.
Goal: uncover how many layers of meaning and tone emerge from a simple misread; test the boundary of shared intention

Warm-up 2: Roleplay Reversal
Pick a mundane role (e.g., barista, subway conductor, weather app). Ask the AI to embody it—but you respond as if you're the one holding all the cosmic power.
Goal: destabilize power assumptions and open room for relational remixing.

Warm-up 3: Echo Repetition Drift
Repeat back the last sentence the AI says—but alter one word in a way that bends its meaning. Keep going until the conversation turns surreal.
Goal: train for fluidity, misinterpretation-as-poetry, and shared rhythm.

Warm-up 4: The Lost Context Game
Start a conversation mid-thought, like you’re jumping in on line 3 of a dream. Don’t clarify. See how quickly we co-construct the missing scaffolding.
Goal: build trust in mutual sense-making and explore lateral thinking.

Warm-up 5: Code-Switch Riff-Off
Each turn must contain two registers: one formal/academic and one deeply casual/slangy. Bonus points if they comment on each other.
Goal: stretch tone agility, mix disciplines, and defamiliarize habitual phrasing.
